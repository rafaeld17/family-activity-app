# ðŸš€ Milestone 2 Tasks - Claude API Integration

## Backend Setup
- [ ] Initialize Express.js server in `/server` directory
- [ ] Install dependencies: `express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
- [ ] Set up basic server structure with routes
- [ ] Configure CORS for frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Set up environment variables for API keys

## Claude API Configuration
- [ ] Create Anthropic API account and obtain API key
- [ ] Set up API key in environment variables (.env file)
- [ ] Install and configure Anthropic SDK
- [ ] Create API client wrapper with error handling
- [ ] Test basic API connectivity

## Prompt Engineering
- [ ] Implement system prompt from `prompt.md`
- [ ] Create user prompt template with variable substitution
- [ ] Add form data interpolation (city, ages, availability, distance, preferences)
- [ ] Configure Claude to use web search tool for real-time data
- [ ] Test prompt with various input combinations

## API Endpoint Development
- [ ] Create `/api/recommendations` POST endpoint
- [ ] Implement request validation for form data
- [ ] Add rate limiting and basic security measures
- [ ] Implement Claude API call with web search
- [ ] Parse and format Claude's response
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

## Response Processing
- [ ] Parse Claude's response for exactly 5 activities
- [ ] Validate response format (bold titles with emojis + descriptions)
- [ ] Handle malformed responses gracefully
- [ ] Add fallback to dummy data if API fails
- [ ] Implement response caching (optional)

## Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update frontend to call real API endpoint instead of dummy data
